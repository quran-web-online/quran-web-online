The Quran is a book of miracles, the word of Allah. This book was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Gabriel in 610 AD. The Quran contains 6236 verses written in Arabic, which is the language Allah chose to speak on earth. The Quran is not only a book of guidance and wisdom, but also tells people how to live their lives and what they should do with their lives.

The Quran teaches us about all aspects of life - from how to treat our parents, siblings, spouse, friends and children; how to live our daily life; how to behave at school or work; and even how we can be good Muslims while living in this world full of temptations.
